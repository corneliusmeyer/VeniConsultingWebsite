<h4>Video Tutorial: Getting started with Podlove Publisher</h4>
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hmrm-jUe6u4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
<h4>Compatible Feeds</h4>
<p>The Publisher makes it easy to create highly expressive, efficient and super compatible podcast feeds with fine grained control over client behavior (e.g. GUID control to replace faulty episodes and for clients to reload) supporting all important meta data.</p>
<h4>Multi-Format Publishing</h4>
<p>The Publisher also makes multi-format publishing &#8211; embracing all modern and legacy audio and video codecs &#8211; a snap. By adopting simple file name conventions, the plugin allows the podcaster to provide individual feeds for certain use cases or audiences without adding work for the podcaster during the publishing process.</p>
<h4>Optimized Web Player</h4>
<p>The Publisher also comes with integrated with the Podlove Web Player plugin (which you do not need to install separately) and fully support its advanced options including multiple audio (MP4 AAC, MP3, Vorbis, Opus) and video (MP4 H.264, WebM, Theora) format support for web browsers. This Web Player is fully HTML5 compatible (but provides Flash fallback for ancient environments) and is ready for all touch based clients too.</p>
<h4>Chapter Support</h4>
<p>The Publisher also makes it easy to publish chapter information in the player to make access to structured episodes even easier. Full support for linking directly to any part of your podcast on the web with instant playback included.</p>
<h4>Flexible Templates</h4>
<p>To round it all up, a flexible template system enables you to published Podcasts in a defined fashion and change the style at any time without having to touch your individual postings later on.</p>
<p>And this is just the beginning. We have a rich roadmap that will bring even more interesting features: integration with helpful services, much improved timeline metadata support (show notes) and much more.</p>

";s:9:"changelog";s:18710:"<h4>3.6.1</h4>
<ul>
<li>fix: sql issue when creating the episode database tables</li>
</ul>
<h4>3.6.0</h4>
<p><strong>New Module: Soundbite</strong></p>
<p>Adds support for the <code>&lt;podcast:soundbite&gt;</code> RSS feed tag.<br />
The intended use includes episodes previews, discoverability, audiogram generation, episode highlights, etc.</p>
<p>Using this module you can specify an audio segment for each episode that can be read by for example audiogram generation services.</p>
<p><strong>New Module: WordPress File Upload</strong></p>
<p>If you are using WordPress Media as storage for your Podlove assets, this new<br />
module adds conveniences.</p>
<p>First, you define a <code>Upload subdirectory</code> for your Podlove assets. This overrides<br />
any WordPress settings, so for example you can safely enable the typical date/month<br />
structure for WordPress attachments and it will not affect your Podlove Uploads.</p>
<p>Then you can update your &#8220;Podlove &#8211; Media &#8211; Upload Location&#8221; setting. You can keep<br />
it empty to let Podlove Publisher take care of it, or set it yourself if you have<br />
a custom file hostname.</p>
<p>Now there is an &#8220;Upload Media File&#8221; button in your episode form above<br />
the &#8220;Episode Media File Slug&#8221; where you can directly upload your files.<br />
If you are using multiple assets, you can upload them all there. Just make sure<br />
they all have the same filename (except the file extension) before you upload.</p>
<h4>3.5.5, 3.5.6</h4>
<p><strong>Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SECURITY: sql injection in &#8220;Social &amp; Donations&#8221; module</li>
<li>transcript API returns list again</li>
<li>PLUS open graph images (use new API)</li>
<li>handle webvtt voice, missing Contributors</li>
<li>related episodes: remove whitespace in shortcode HTML to fix rendering in Spotify</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>webvtt transcripts use public contributor name</li>
<li>transcript voices / contributors:
<ul>
<li>you can now select &#8220;none&#8221; in the voice assignment</li>
<li>only voices with an assigned contributor (and not &#8220;none&#8221;) appear in public transcripts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>generate default copyright claim if it is not explcitly set</li>
</ul>
<h4>3.5.4</h4>
<ul>
<li>adds copyright field in &#8220;Podcast Settings &#8211; Directory&#8221;, which is apparently required by the Apple Podcast Directory since yesterday.</li>
<li>perf: remove frontend.js (inline logic to download button HTML)</li>
</ul>
<h4>3.5.2 / 3.5.3</h4>
<p>This releases reverses all changes to Permalinks in releases 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.</p>
<p>I severely underestimated the effect these changes would have and revert all changes until I find a better solution. It’s simply not acceptable to change episode URLs, especially without an option for automatic redirects.</p>
<p>Please verify your episode URLs and the two expert settings “Permalink structure for episodes” and “Episode Pages”.</p>
<p>What to do if you have used the “PODLOVE_ENABLE_PERMALINK_MAGIC” constant? It has no effect any more and you can safely remove it from your config file.</p>
<p>What happened to the “Simple Episode Permalink” setting from release 3.5.1? It has been removed, too.</p>
<p>Sorry for the trouble.<br />
Happy podcasting 🙂</p>
<p><strong>Other</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>fix: remove usage of PHP 7.1 syntax in one file</li>
</ul>
<h4>3.5.1</h4>
<h4>2021-04-14</h4>
<ul>
<li>add: expert setting to make episode permalinks <code>/%postname%/</code></li>
<li>add: include Publisher Database Version in system report</li>
<li>drop WordPress version requirement to 4.9.6</li>
</ul>
<h4>3.5.0</h4>
<p><strong>Breaking Change</strong></p>
<p>Removes two expert settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Permalink structure for episodes&#8221; and</li>
<li>&#8220;Episode pages&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>These settings allowed to define custom URL structures for episodes and the episode archive.<br />
However they have caused trouble for a long time (see <a href="https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/issues/1038" rel="nofollow ugc">#1038</a>)<br />
and the only viable way out seems to remove them.</p>
<p>How does that affect you?</p>
<p>If you have never touched these settings, feel free to shrug, smile and move on.</p>
<p>If you <em>are</em> using these settings, I encourage you to consider not using them as they are mostly of cosmetic nature.<br />
Should you however prefer to keep everything as is (including the known bugs of erratically broken permalinks / URLs), you can<br />
enable the settings back with a single line of code in your wp-config.php:</p>
<pre><code>    define('PODLOVE_ENABLE_PERMALINK_MAGIC', true);
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Experimental: Full-Page Podlove Templates</strong></p>
<p>If you want to create a 100% custom page based on an episode but without all the WordPress theme around, this is for you.<br />
Possible use case: A dedicated page to print the episode transcript.</p>
<ol>
<li>create a new Podlove Template, for example <code>page-episode-transcipt</code></li>
<li>Write that transcript as a <em>full HTML page</em>. That means it starts with <code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;&lt;html&gt;</code> and ends with <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>!</li>
<li>Append <code>?podlove_template_page=page-episode-transcipt</code> to your public episode URL. For example if your episode is <code>https://example.com/ep001/</code>, then open <code>https://example.com/ep001/?podlove_template_page=page-episode-transcipt</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Very simple example template:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Transcript | {{ episode.title }} | {{ podcast.title }}&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Here's the transcript for podcast &lt;strong&gt;{{ podcast.title }}&lt;/strong&gt; episode &lt;strong&gt;{{ episode.title }}&lt;/strong&gt;:
  &lt;/p&gt;

  [podlove-transcript]

&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

player for audio and video media files that is optimized and extended for the specific needs of podcasters.<br />
It has a native integration with <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/podlove-podcasting-plugin-for-wordpress/">Podlove Publisher</a>, can be used as a shortcode and also plays well with Gutenberg Blocks.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>There are basically four ways to use the Podlove Web Player:</p>
<h4>1 Manual WordPress Shortcode</h4>
<p>Use a simple shortcode in your posts and pages, and the Podlove Web Player will appear, playing any media file you want to assign. Basic usage:</p>
<pre><code>[podlove-web-player
  theme="default"
  config="default"
  title="My episode title"
  subtitle="Episode Subtitle"
  poster="/files/path/to/poster.png"
  chapters="/files/path/to/chapters.json"
  transcripts="/files/path/to/transcripts.json"
  playlist="/files/path/to/playlist.json"
  src="http://mysite.com/mymedia.mp3"
  size="1337"
  show="My show title"
  duration="03:33"
]
</code></pre>
<p>Use an existing post with a media enclosure that is provided from plugins like Blubrry:</p>
<pre><code>[podlove-web-player
  theme="default"
  config="default"
  post="1234"
]
</code></pre>
<p>Or in case you have our <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/podlove-podcasting-plugin-for-wordpress/">Podlove Publisher</a> installed:</p>
<pre><code>[podlove-web-player
  theme="default"
  config="default"
  publisher="1234"
]
</code></pre>
<h4>2 Using WordPress Gutenberg Blocks</h4>
<p>You can choose between different references, like Podlove Publisher, Blocks or you can add the meta data manually. Right now the latter option is limited to a limited set of attributes, this will be expanded in further releases.</p>
<h4>3 Automatic Integration with Podcasting Engines</h4>
<p>If you are using Podlove Publisher you should be able to select it in the Publisher Player settings.<br />
In case you are still using Blubrry you can simply enable the automatic insertions on enclosures in the settings and choose the position.</p>
<h3>Help &amp; Support</h3>

<p>If you want to include a Podlove Subscribe Button in a WordPress page (or a post) just put the shortcode <code>[podlove-subscribe-button]</code> at the desired position in your text. Use the following shortcode parameters to configure it properly:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>button</code> &#8211; the ID of one of your preconfigured buttons</li>
<li><code>size</code> &#8211; one of &#8216;small&#8217;, &#8216;medium&#8217;, &#8216;big&#8217;</li>
<li><code>width</code> &#8211; specify desired button width in CSS compatibles values or &#8216;auto&#8217; automatic width depending on context.</li>
<li><code>color</code> &#8211; specify the color of the button in a CSS compatible format (keyword, rgb-hex, rgb, rgba, hsl, hsla)</li>
<li><code>style</code> &#8211; default is filled, options are &#8216;outline&#8217; and &#8216;frameless&#8217;</li>
<li><code>format</code> &#8211; default is a rectangle, options are &#8216;square&#8217; and &#8216;cover&#8217; (<strong>Note</strong>: &#8216;cover&#8217; has a max size of 300px)</li>
<li><code>hide</code> &#8211; if set to <code>true</code> the button will not be shown (useful if you want to use your own element)</li>
<li><code>language</code> &#8211; specify the language the texts on the button and popup should be in (currently supports &#8216;de&#8217;, &#8216;en&#8217;, &#8216;eo&#8217;, &#8216;fi&#8217;, &#8216;fr&#8217;, &#8216;nl&#8217;, &#8216;zh&#8217; and &#8216;ja&#8217;)</li>
</ul>

";s:3:"faq";s:1367:"
<h4>I&#8217;m running the Podlove Publisher. Do I need this plugin to display a Subscribe button?</h4>
<p>
<p>Yes and No. If you simply want to display a Subscribe Button for your Podcast you publish with the Podlove Publisher you do not need this plugin as the Publisher itself provides this functionality. If you want to display multiple Subscribe Buttons you can use the Subscribe Button plugin.</p>
</p>
<h4>Where do I create those &#8220;Network-wide&#8221; Buttons?</h4>
<p>
<p>You can find the Panel in the Networks Settings Section</p>
</p>
<h4>Does this plugin actually contain the code for the button?</h4>
<p>
<p>No. This plugin just embeds the code that is needed to display the Podlove Subscribe Button. The button itself is served live from api.podlove.org</p>
</p>
<h4>Do I update the plugin to get support for more clients?</h4>
<p>
<p>No. As the Podlove Subscribe Button is hosted centrally, it gets updated regularly independent from this pugin.</p>
</p>
<h4>I am a podcast app developer and would like my app be listed in the button. What do I need to do?</h4>
<p>
<p>Consult the information provided on <a href="https://podlove.org/podlove-subscribe-button" rel="nofollow ugc">the technical information page</a> at podlove.org on how the button works and what app developers need to support and do in order to get listed in the button.</p>

Is Site Kit free?
</h4>
<p>
<p>The Site Kit plugin is free and open source, and will remain so. Individual Google products included in Site Kit are subject to standard terms and fees (if any) for those products.</p>
</p>
<dt id='what%20are%20the%20minimum%20requirements%20for%20site%20kit%3F'>
What are the minimum requirements for Site Kit?
</h4>
<p>
<p>In order to successfully install and use Site Kit, your site must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress version 4.7+</li>
<li>PHP version 5.6+</li>
<li>Modern browser – Internet Explorer is not supported</li>
<li>Is publicly accessible – it isn’t in maintenance mode, accessible only via password, or otherwise blocked</li>
<li>REST API is available – Site Kit must be able to communicate via REST API with Google services. To ensure that the REST API is available for your site, go to Tools &gt; Site Health.</li>

Why is my dashboard showing “gathering data” and none of my service data?
</h4>
<p>
<p>It can take a few days after connecting Site Kit to a Google service for data to begin to display in your dashboard. The “gathering data” message typically appears when you’ve recently set up a Google service (i.e. just created a new Analytics account) and/or your site is new, and data is not yet available for display.</p>
<p>If you are still seeing this message after a few days, feel free to get in touch with us on the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/google-site-kit/">support forum</a>.</p>

<dt id='why%20aren%E2%80%99t%20any%20ads%20appearing%20on%20my%20site%20after%20i%20connected%20adsense%3F'>
Why aren’t any ads appearing on my site after I connected AdSense?
</h4>
<p>
<p>If you’re new to AdSense when you connect via Site Kit, your new AdSense account and your site will need to be manually reviewed and approved for ads by the AdSense team. Ads will not display until your account and site have been approved. <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/76228" rel="nofollow ugc">Check out this guide for more information about the approval process and timeline.</a></p>
<p>You can check your approval status in Site Kit by going to Settings &gt; Connected Services &gt; AdSense and clicking “Check your site status.” This link will direct you to AdSense. If you see “Ready,” your account and site have been approved and should be displaying ads. If you see “Getting ready…,” your account and site are still under review and your site will not display ads until they have been approved.</p>
<p>If the AdSense snippet is successfully embedded on your site <strong>and</strong> your account and site have been approved, but your site is still not showing ads, <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/#topic=3373519" rel="nofollow ugc">contact the AdSense Help Center for assistance</a>.</p>

<dt id='is%20site%20kit%20gdpr%20compliant%3F'>
Is Site Kit GDPR compliant?
</h4>
<p>
<p>When using Site Kit, site owners are responsible for managing notice and consent requirements – including GDPR requirements – as described in <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" rel="nofollow ugc">Google’s Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p>By default, Site Kit does anonymize IP addresses upon activation of the Google Analytics module. In addition, Site Kit provides a mechanism in the form of a simple API for cookie consent plugins to integrate with Site Kit and prevent Site Kit&#8217;s Google service snippets from being rendered on a page if the user has not granted consent. More information about how this API works is available in <a href="https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/issues/2087" rel="nofollow ugc">this GitHub issue</a>.</p>
