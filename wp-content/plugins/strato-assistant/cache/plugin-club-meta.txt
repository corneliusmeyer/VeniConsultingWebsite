<h4>Drag &amp; Drop Contact Form Builder</h4>
<p>We were tired of the bloated and buggy contact form builder plugins. That&#8217;s why we built WPForms to adapt to your workflow and allow you to create custom contact forms in minutes. By using our easy to use <a href="https://wpforms.com/features/drag-drop-online-form-builder/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin" rel="friend nofollow ugc">drag and drop online form builder</a>, you can easily add custom form fields, rearrange them, and basically create a complete contact form in 5 minutes or less.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t just take our word. See what one of the WordPress experts are saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WPForms is by far the <strong>easiest form plugin to use</strong>. My clients love WPForms and it&#8217;s one of the few plugins they can use without any training. As a developer I appreciate how fast, modern, clean and extensible it is.<br />
  Bill Erickson &#8211; Expert WordPress Consultant</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Pre-built Form Templates</h4>
<p>Building contact forms in WordPress can be time consuming. Why?</p>
<p>Because every other WordPress contact form builder plugin requires you to build your contact form from scratch. The truth is it&#8217;s often not necessary to create a contact form completely from scratch unless you really want to.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re looking to create a simple contact form, marketing form, request a quote form, donation form, payment order form, registration form, or a subscription form, we have a form template for you inside our contact form builder.</p>
<p>WPForms comes with <a href="https://wpforms.com/features/form-templates/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin" rel="friend nofollow ugc">pre-built form templates</a> to help you save time. You can add, remove, or re-arrange fields as necessary.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://wpforms.com/templates/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin" rel="friend nofollow ugc">300+ Pre-Made WPForms Form Template Demo</a></p>
<h4>Mobile Ready, SEO Friendly and Optimized for Speed</h4>
<p>WPForms&#8217; contact forms are 100% responsive and mobile-friendly by default. We also optimized every query on the front-end and the back-end to ensure maximum speed &#8211; Yes, WPForms is one of the fastest WordPress contact form plugin.</p>
<p>You can embed your contact form on any page with optimized title and description. With the speed and proper formatting, WPForms is also one of the most SEO friendly contact form plugin.</p>
<h4>All the Fields &amp; Features that You Need to Succeed</h4>
<p>From star ratings to file uploads to multi-page contact forms with progress bar, we have all the fields you need.</p>
<p>You can easily integrate your contact forms with an email marketing service or collect payments for bookings and orders. WPForms allows you to do it all.</p>
<p>The best part is, you can do it all without hiring a developer.</p>
<p>See what one business owner has to say about WPForms&#8217; contact form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a business owner, time is my most valuable asset. WPForms allow me to create smart contact forms with just a few clicks. With their pre-built form templates and the drag &amp; drop builder, I can create a new form that works in less than 2 minutes without writing a single line of code. Well worth the investment.<br />
  David Henzel &#8211; Co-founder of MaxCDN</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Surveys &amp; Polls</h4>
<p>Along with contact form, you can also use WPForms to create surveys and polls.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://wpforms.com/addons/surveys-and-polls-addon/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin" rel="friend nofollow ugc">WordPress Survey plugin addon</a> comes with smart survey fields including likert scale, star ratings, multiple choice, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and more, so you can create custom survey forms like Survey Monkey (without the high costs).</p>
<p>WPForms offer the best-in class survey reporting. You can use our interactive reports to customize the graphs, export them for your presentations, and even display the aggregate results to your users.</p>
<p>The best part about WPForms survey reports is that it can retroactively work on any old contact form or feedback survey contact form created with WPForms.</p>
<p>Thousands of businesses love WPForms surveys for creating employee feedback form, customer feedback form, online petition form, and more.</p>
<p>You can also use the surveys &amp; polls addon to easily create a poll on your site. To save you time when creating a user poll, we have added a built-in poll forms template. Our poll feature offers real-time reports, so you can share poll results with the user immediately after they submit their vote.</p>
<p>Just like the contact form, you can embed your surveys and polls inside any post, page, or widget area in WordPress.</p>
<h4>Membership and Default WordPress Forms</h4>
<p>Aside from building simple contact forms which every WordPress site needs, WPForms also helps you create better default WordPress forms.</p>
<p>For example, you can use WPForms to create custom WordPress login forms and custom WordPress user registration forms which are great for <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/ultimate-guide-to-creating-a-wordpress-membership-site/" rel="nofollow ugc">membership sites</a>.</p>
<p>For membership sites, you can also use WPForms to create a password-protected contact form or even a members only contact form which is restricted to logged-in users only.</p>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re not using a WordPress membership plugin, you can use WPForms to create membership registration forms, online RSVP forms, and other address book contact forms.</p>
<p>Bloggers and publishers can use our WordPress post submission forms to accept guest posts, testimonials contact form to collect testimonials, and partnership agreement forms to grow their business.</p>
<h4>Payment Form, Donation Form, Booking Form, and More</h4>
<p>While WPForms started out as a contact form plugin, it has evolved into a powerful custom forms solution that you can use to create a payment form, donation form, registration form, online booking form, mobile form, and basically any type of custom form you need.</p>
<p>WPForms integrates with both PayPal, Stripe, Square, and Authorize.Net so you can easily create a credit card payment form to accept payments on your website. If you&#8217;re using SSL, then you can use our Stripe, Square, or Authorize.Net Payment forms to accept credit card payments directly on your website. Alternatively you can use our PayPal payment form to make a donation form and accept payments online.</p>
<p>Aside from simple order forms, business owners also use WPForms to create custom product purchase forms, t-shirt order forms, online booking forms, and more.</p>
<p>We understand that sometimes you may need to create a contact form that require a signature. WPForms comes with a signature field to collect user signature on your WordPress forms or even create custom signature forms.</p>
<p>You can do all of this while still using the same easy-to-use contact form builder that&#8217;s loved by over 5 million users.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am so impressed with this plugin. I decided to give it a shot over some of the other form plugins, and I am so glad I did. It works well, is so easy to use and customize. The support is amazing on top of it all. I got the pro version because I was so pleased. Highly recommend.<br />
  Micky73 &#8211; WordPress user</p>

<h4>Forms that are Optimized for Conversion and Results</h4>
<p>With our Form Pages addon, you can create distraction-free custom form landing pages like Google Forms and Wufoo right inside WordPress, so you can increase conversions without the high costs (<a href="https://wpforms.com/addons/form-pages-addon/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin" rel="friend nofollow ugc">See Form Pages Demo</a>).</p>
<p>To improve form completion rate, we created Conversational Forms&reg; which helps you make your generic feedback form and other custom contact forms feel more human by adding an interactive form layout. Our conversational forms are similar to Typeform without the high subscription costs (<a href="https://wpforms.com/addons/conversational-forms-addon/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin" rel="friend nofollow ugc">See Conversational Forms Demo</a>).</p>
<p>WPForms also has other conversion optimization features such as our smart form logic that lets you create dynamic contact forms where fields change based on user&#8217;s answer, multi-page contact forms with progress bar, and other advanced contact forms.</p>
<p>WPForms form analytics integration with MonsterInsights allow you to easily track your lead capture forms, newsletter signup forms, request a quote contact form, and other important forms on your site.</p>
<h4>Easy to Customize and Extend</h4>
<p>You can easily customize your contact forms with our section dividers, HTML blocks, and custom CSS.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using Elementor or Divi page builders our native integrations let you quickly customize the style of your forms. Embedding forms in Elementor and Divi has never been easier.</p>
<p>We also knew that our developer friends may want to extend simple contact forms further. That&#8217;s why WPForms come with tons of hooks and filters to create custom functionality.</p>
<p>Since contact forms are essential for marketing, WPForms is a must have plugin for every website!</p>

ShortPixel 🙂</strong></p>
<p>Regenerate Thumbnails Advanced (RTA) plugin comes in handy when you install a new WordPress theme on your site that has different image sizes. While the newly uploaded images will be cropped and resized to fit your new theme, the old thumbnails will remain unchanged.

<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose the quality of the regenerated thumbs.</li>
<li>Option to remove not-used-anymore thumbnails.</li>
<li>Remove metadata for missing images and thumbnails</li>
<li>Fully integrated with <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortpixel-image-optimiser/">ShortPixel Image Optimizer</a>.</li>
<li>Option to select the thumbnail size for featured and non-featured images.</li>
<li>Option to easily add as many extra thumbnail sizes as you wish.</li>
<li>Interval selection (last day, week, month, all) for the thumbs that will be regenerated.</li>
<li>Clean and simple interface where you have a progress bar showing you the percentage of images regenerated.</li>
<li>Resume function &#8211; the regeneration process will continue from where it was left in case you accidentally close the processing tab in your browser.</li>
</ul>

tables. You can embed the tables into posts, pages, or text widgets with a simple Shortcode. Table data can be edited in a spreadsheet-like interface, so no coding is necessary. Tables can contain any type of data, even formulas that will be evaluated. An additional JavaScript library adds features like sorting, pagination, filtering, and more for site visitors. Tables can be imported and exported from/to Excel, CSV, HTML, and JSON files.</p>

<h4>TablePress Extensions</h4>
<p>Additional features and useful enhancements are available as separate plugins, called <a href="https://tablepress.org/extensions/" rel="nofollow ugc">TablePress Extensions</a>, on the plugin website.</p>
<p>Do you have a lot of tables? You can organize them in folders! <a href="https://tablepress.org/extensions/wicked-folders-pro/" rel="nofollow ugc">Wicked Folders Pro supports TablePress</a> and might be the right solution for you.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>After installing the plugin, you can create and manage tables on the &#8220;TablePress&#8221; screen in the WordPress Dashboard.</p>
<p>To show one of your tables in a post or on a page, embed the Shortcode <code>[table id=&lt;the-ID&gt; /]</code> into a &#8220;Shortcode&#8221; block at the desired place in the block editor. Each table has a unique ID that needs to be adjusted in that Shortcode.</p>
<p>After that, you might want to change the styling of the table. You can do this by entering CSS commands into the &#8220;Custom CSS&#8221; textarea on the &#8220;Plugin Options&#8221; screen. Some examples for common styling changes can be found on the <a href="https://tablepress.org/faq/" rel="nofollow ugc">TablePress FAQ page</a>.<br />
You may also add certain features (like sorting, pagination, filtering, alternating row colors, row highlighting, print name and/or description, &#8230;) by enabling the corresponding checkboxes on a table&#8217;s &#8220;Edit&#8221; screen.</p>

Are there any troubleshooting steps you&#8217;d suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread?
</h4>
<p>
<p>First, make sure that you&#8217;re running the latest version of The Events Calendar. If you’re running Events Calendar PRO or  any other add-ons, make sure those are current / running the latest code as well.</p>
<p>The most common issues we see are either plugin or theme conflicts. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just The Events Calendar is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwenty/">Twenty Twenty</a> theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you’ll know that is the source of the conflict.</p>
<p>Note that we aren’t going to say “tough luck” if you identify a plugin/theme conflict. While we can’t guarantee 100% integration with any plugin or theme out there, we will do our best (and reach out the plugin/theme author as needed) to figure out a solution that benefits everyone.</p>

<p>Users of the free The Events Calendar should post their questions in the plugin&#8217;s <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/the-events-calendar/">WordPress.org forum</a>, which we visit about once a week. Please make sure to read <a href="https://evnt.is/19oc" rel="nofollow ugc">our sticky post</a> providing an overview of the support we provide free users BEFORE posting. If you find you&#8217;re not getting support in as timely a fashion as you wish, you might want to consider purchasing a license for Events Calendar Pro.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re already an Events Calendar Pro user, you&#8217;re entitled access to our actively-monitored <a href="https://evnt.is/1aju" rel="nofollow ugc">Premium Support</a> on our website.

How do I sell tickets to events on my calendar?

<p>
<p>You&#8217;ll want to use our <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/event-tickets/">Event Tickets</a> plugin for that.

<p>Unfortunately, no. However, you can use event categories or tags to create calendar views that only display certain events.

<p>With Events Calendar Pro, you can use <a href="https://evnt.is/1ajw" rel="nofollow ugc">shortcodes</a> to embed your calendar on other WordPress pages and posts, then filter that calendar by category.</p>

<li>Fix &#8211; Multiple fixes regarding linked post types (e.g. Organizers and custom post types) &#8211; props to @natureslens and others for reporting these [105116]:
<ul>
<li>Now correctly saves in their drag-and-drop order</li>
<li>Deprecated the functions added in version 4.6.13 that previously attempted to fix ordering logic but was not done in a backwards-compatible way: <code>get_order_meta_key()</code> and <code>tribe_sanitize_organizers()</code></li>
<li>We no longer rely on a separate postmeta value dedicated to ordering linked posts (e.g. <code>_EventOrganizerID_Order</code>), and you may want to remove all such values from your database after re-saving any events that have linked posts and their ordering is important</li>
<li><code>tribe_get_linked_posts_by_post_type()</code> now works as expected, no longer returning zero results in error, nor returning all of the post type&#8217;s posts if there are none linked. The <code>tribe_events_return_all_linked_posts_if_none</code> filter was added, as it is necessary for this fix.</li>
<li>Editing an existing event no longer loses the linked posts just because they were not part of the submission. Example of the bug in prior versions: If organizers are editable in the wp-admin event edit screen but not on the Community Events &#8220;event edit&#8221; form (via template override or other custom code), all pre-existing organizers were removed in error.</li>
</ul>

Is Site Kit free?
</h4>
<p>
<p>The Site Kit plugin is free and open source, and will remain so. Individual Google products included in Site Kit are subject to standard terms and fees (if any) for those products.</p>
</p>
<dt id='what%20are%20the%20minimum%20requirements%20for%20site%20kit%3F'>
What are the minimum requirements for Site Kit?
</h4>
<p>
<p>In order to successfully install and use Site Kit, your site must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress version 4.7+</li>
<li>PHP version 5.6+</li>
<li>Modern browser – Internet Explorer is not supported</li>
<li>Is publicly accessible – it isn’t in maintenance mode, accessible only via password, or otherwise blocked</li>
<li>REST API is available – Site Kit must be able to communicate via REST API with Google services. To ensure that the REST API is available for your site, go to Tools &gt; Site Health.</li>

Why is my dashboard showing “gathering data” and none of my service data?
</h4>
<p>
<p>It can take a few days after connecting Site Kit to a Google service for data to begin to display in your dashboard. The “gathering data” message typically appears when you’ve recently set up a Google service (i.e. just created a new Analytics account) and/or your site is new, and data is not yet available for display.</p>
<p>If you are still seeing this message after a few days, feel free to get in touch with us on the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/google-site-kit/">support forum</a>.</p>

Why aren’t any ads appearing on my site after I connected AdSense?
</h4>
<p>
<p>If you’re new to AdSense when you connect via Site Kit, your new AdSense account and your site will need to be manually reviewed and approved for ads by the AdSense team. Ads will not display until your account and site have been approved. <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/76228" rel="nofollow ugc">Check out this guide for more information about the approval process and timeline.</a></p>
<p>You can check your approval status in Site Kit by going to Settings &gt; Connected Services &gt; AdSense and clicking “Check your site status.” This link will direct you to AdSense. If you see “Ready,” your account and site have been approved and should be displaying ads. If you see “Getting ready…,” your account and site are still under review and your site will not display ads until they have been approved.</p>
<p>If the AdSense snippet is successfully embedded on your site <strong>and</strong> your account and site have been approved, but your site is still not showing ads, <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/#topic=3373519" rel="nofollow ugc">contact the AdSense Help Center for assistance</a>.</p>

<dt id='is%20site%20kit%20gdpr%20compliant%3F'>
Is Site Kit GDPR compliant?
</h4>
<p>
<p>When using Site Kit, site owners are responsible for managing notice and consent requirements – including GDPR requirements – as described in <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" rel="nofollow ugc">Google’s Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p>By default, Site Kit does anonymize IP addresses upon activation of the Google Analytics module. In addition, Site Kit provides a mechanism in the form of a simple API for cookie consent plugins to integrate with Site Kit and prevent Site Kit&#8217;s Google service snippets from being rendered on a page if the user has not granted consent. More information about how this API works is available in <a href="https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/issues/2087" rel="nofollow ugc">this GitHub issue</a>.</p>
